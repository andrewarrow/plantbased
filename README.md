# Data doesn't lie
Reframing as billions of meat eaters are going to die over the next few years is not a stretch. You could almost imagine mother nature purposely "manifesting" covid as a way to dramatically thin out the human population. And what humans would mother nature like to keep? The ones that watched seaspiracy and got it. Not the ones that watched it and said, eh, fish taste good!

# Hunting my own elk
I think you'll be fine with mother nature if you hunt and kill yourself the meat you eat. Understanding seaspiracy means the "industry" scale of all humans getting easy meat. That's the problem. Not the special individual that wants to hunt some prey in the wild, bond with it, maybe even stare at it for hours while waiting for perfect shot, killing the animal that you've now bonded with yourself, getting the meat, all this work lets you earn that meat and you are still okay with the makers of seaspiracy I say. [Hunting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3iVpSUriSg)

# I can be healthy and still eat lazy meat
Yes, you can drive through [in-n-out](https://www.in-n-out.com/) a couple times a week. You can get super market sushi. You could even limit yourself to just [chick-fil-a](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/) chicken. But anyway you slice it you aren't moving the needle on this new earth we're trying to create. There is just one way to fix our problems. Dry up the demand for meat. Make it so you can't sell Tuna because just about zero people want to buy it. Big change I know. Lazy meat is so, so delicious. 

"I got vaccinated, have a good body weight, I don't need to give up delicious lazy meat."

Try hunting! No really, watch the hunting clip above, you can still eat interesting meat with effort.

But this isn't just about *your* health.

# Eating meat is not obscene, collecting it at industry scales is
This is not a us vs. them thing. I don't want to put in the hunting effort so I'm eating just plants for right now in my day to day life.
This doesn't mean I won't someday go hunting. I can still be a meat eater but go through years of city life with zero animal products in my diet.
